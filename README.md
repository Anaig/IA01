Artificial intelligence : Creation of an expert system

This expert system was developed in LISP and it is based on the stylist Cristina Cordula's advice. The goal is to help the user, man or woman, find the correct clothes depending on one's morphology and on the occasion (casual, serious...).
We created knowledge and rule bases, that could be strengthen if the project was improved. 

The system communicates with the user asking a number of question in order to know the context. It then gives a set of advice with the detailed recommended outfit. 

The system can use two different strategies : a depth-first forward chaining or a breadth-first forward chaining.
